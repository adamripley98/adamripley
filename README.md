# Personal Website

This is my first personal website - built by making slight modifications to a bootstrap template. The goal of this site was to quickly get a personal site up - I plan to build a personal website from scratch within the next few months to get more frontend practice. You can checkout the site live at [adamripley.com](https://www.adamripley.com)! Developed by @adamripley98.
